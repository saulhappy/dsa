Does my problem match this pattern?

Yes, if all of these conditions are fulfilled:

The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, it’s in an array, in a linked list, or in a string of characters.
The input data is sorted, or else, arranged in a way that is relevant to the problem, such as numeric data sorted in ascending or descending order, or characters arranged symmetrically.
We limit our focus to a specific range of elements within the input data, as dictated by the positions of the two pointers, allowing us to consider a small subset of elements rather than the entire set.

No, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:

The input data cannot be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, it’s neither in an array, nor in a linked list, nor in a string of characters.
The problem requires an exhaustive search of the solution space, that is, eliminating one solution does not eliminate any others.
